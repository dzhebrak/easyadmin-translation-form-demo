# easyadmin-translation-form-demo
This repository demonstrates how to add entity translation functionality to Easyadmin administrative backend using knplabs/doctrine-behaviors and a2lix/translation-form-bundle

An "Article" entity will be created with the ability to translate title, slug and content into multiple languages (English and French - mandatory, German - optional), as well as the ability to filter by translated fields.
